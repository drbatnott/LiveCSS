    <h1>Sparkle the Penguin wizard</h1>
    <p>
        Once upon a time there was a penguin wizard. He was a very happy penguin.<br />
        He could turn anything into fish just by pointing his wand at it and<br />
        declaring it to be fish.<br />
        The other penguins were often jealous of sparkle so the tried to eject<br />
        him from the island where they lived. However, they were very scared<br />
        of upsetting him. He might turn them into a fish.<br />
        One night when Sparkle was sleeping a group of the other penguins<br>
        set off for the other side of the island. They knew that there we{re<br>
        men living there who had large boats. they used for fishing. <br />
        They negotiated with the men to come and capture Sparkle as they<br />
        said he could work for them,turning things into fish and in return<br>
        Sparkle would be able to try other sorts of things.<br />
        The men were doubtful. They had never met talking penguins before<br />
        and besides they worried that the penguins would take over the fishing<br />
        grounds and what if Sparkle did not want to work with them?
